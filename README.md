# uploadfile-test

## Setup
### Requirements
- Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- Install [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/other/)
- Install `make`: `sudo apt install build-essential`
- Install [go](https://golang.org/dl/), version at least `1.19.1`
- Install (vegeta)[https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta#source]

## Explain my application:
### Concept
- Our application will serve a api, user can call this api to send some data, we will forward these data to gcp or s3.
- The payload size limit is 10KB
- API can still handle/recieve requests from clients without having to wait for the uploading process to complete.

=> For these reasons above, I decided use [Nats-Jetstream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream) pub/sub in this project. 
It is same like queue, it has publisher and subscriber. So when user make a request, the data will be published by publisher to the queue, 
subscriber listens the queue, then the data will be processed by subscriber and send it to gcp/s3.

- Pros:
    - User don't need to wait the uploading process complete.
    - Easy to scale, we can easy to scale the subscriber more resource to process the logic faster.
    - If publisher or subscriber is crash/down, the data are still storing in nats, then we don't lost the data.
- Cons:
    - It makes our application quite complexity.

## Run the application:
### In order to run the application:
1. Run command `make init` to start the nats and application. 
2. Run command `make call-api-with-normal-payload` to make a request to server with 8080 port. I can go to `logs.log` to see the process.
```
2022-11-13T10:18:10.603Z	INFO	publisher/publisher.go:32	UploadPublish: Publish msg success	{"msg_id": "c39f8d06-9e4f-4e40-afaa-635b76782840"}

```
3. Run command `make call-api-with-heavy-payload` to make a request with heavy payload, then we got this log:
```
2022-11-13T10:18:06.464Z	ERROR	transport/route.go:36	Payload is over 10KB
```
4. Run command `make load-testing` to load testing our api:
```

5. Run command `unit-test` for unit test:
```
go test -count=3 ./internals/...
